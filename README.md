# EnergyDAO
## Problem
According to Our World in Data, in 2019, [64% of our electricity came from fossil fuel](https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels) and only [11% came from renewable technologies](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy). The extraction and transport of fossil fuels causes harm to water, wildlife, plants and humans. Moreover, the burning of fossil fuels releases gas that are harmful for the environnment, raising the planet's temperature and ultimately destroying wildlife and its habitat.  

## Mission
EnergyDAO's goal is to make renewable energy the main source of the world's electricity.
